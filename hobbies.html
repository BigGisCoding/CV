  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Reading: a bunch of different things.</li><br>
    <li>Writing: both on my Mac and with my Faber-Castell fountain pen. I've recently developed an interest in cursive handwriting.</li><br>
    <li>Calisthenics: remember those "For Dummies" books that try to teach you all sorts of things? Well, that's the level I'm currently at.</li><br>
    <li>Scuba-diving: same as above, but one has to start somewhere, right?</li><br>
    <li><a href="https://500px.com/search?q=Gabriele+Andolina&type=photos">Photography:</a> it doesn't get better...</li><br>
    <li>Cooking: good enough not to poison my banqueters!</li><br>
    <li>Apologetics</li><br>
    <li>Many other things that at different times pop up in my mind or that still remain to be discovered!</li><br>
  </ol>
